# Venkata Ravi Teja - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, experience, certifications, and contact information in a modern and responsive design.

## 🔗 Live Website

[https://venkataravi-teja.github.io/](https://venkataravi-teja.github.io/Portfolio/) <!-- Update this after enabling GitHub Pages -->

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom styling, media queries)
- JavaScript (typewriter effect, modal, form submission, scroll animations)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
- Web3Forms for contact form submissions

## 📁 Features

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Animated typewriter intro
- Smooth scroll and active navigation
- Modal pop-up for certifications
- Contact form with validation and CAPTCHA
- Project and experience cards with hover effects

## 🧠 How It Works

- The `index.html` file contains the main structure.
- The CSS is written directly in the `<style>` tag for simplicity (can be split into a separate file).
- JavaScript at the end of the file handles interactivity like:
  - Typewriter animation
  - Hamburger menu toggling
  - Scroll-based animations
  - Modal logic for viewing certificates
